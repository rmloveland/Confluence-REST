Confluence::REST - Thin wrapper around Confluence's REST API

CAUTION - THIS IS ALPHA CODE

L<Confluence|http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence> is a proprietary
wiki from L<Atlassian|http://www.atlassian.com/>.

This module is a thin wrapper around L<Confluence's REST
API|https://developer.atlassian.com/confcloud/confluence-rest-api-39985291.html>,
which is superseding its old SOAP API.  (If you want to interact with
the SOAP API, there's another Perl module called
L<Confluence::Client::XMLRPC|https://github.com/heikojansen/confluence-client-xmlrpc>.

This code is basically L<JIRA::REST|metacpan.org/pod/JIRA::REST> with
some tweaks to get it to work with the Confluence REST API.

For an example of a script that uses this library, see the file C<bin/csp>.
