Confluence::REST - Thin wrapper around Confluence's REST API

CAUTION - THIS IS ALPHA CODE

L<Confluence|http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence> is a proprietary
wiki from L<Atlassian|http://www.atlassian.com/>.

This module is a thin wrapper around 
L<Confluence's REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/confluence/REST/latest/>, 
which is superseding its old SOAP API, for which there is another Perl module called
L<Confluence::Client::XMLRPC|https://github.com/heikojansen/confluence-client-xmlrpc>.
